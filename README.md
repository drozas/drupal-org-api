Understading "community-oriented" contributions: a SNA of mentorship relationships within the Drupal community
==============

Drupal.org provides a public API for retrieving common data which includes all node types, users, comments and more. You can find documentation on that here: https://www.drupal.org/api

This project makes use of https://github.com/EclipseGc/drupal-org-api , which provides an SDK in PHP to interact with this API, in order to obtain data related to the relationships of mentorship between members of the Drupal community. The idea is to explore the relevance of "community-oriented" contribution activities, beyond the idea of studying FLOSS communities looking tipically at "code-oriented" activities. If you have a further interest on this project, you can check this post and video from a presentation at Drupal Show and Tell London: http://p2pvalue.eu/blog/talk-silver-code-gold-contribution-beyond-source-code-freelibre-open-source-software Feel free to contact me: drozas (at) surrey (dot) ac (dot) uk or http://www.davidrozas.com I really appreciate any thoughts/feedback/suggestions!

This script has been designed for researching purposes for the PhD thesis: "Drupal as a Commons-Based Peer Production community: an ethnographic perspective" (http://www.surrey.ac.uk/sociology/people/phd/david_rozas/index.htm).
