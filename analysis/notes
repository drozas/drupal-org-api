Steps to validate and prepare data (e.g. using PHPmyAdmin):
===========================================================

- Import all data from several threads (more easily from https://github.com/drozas/drupal-org-api/tree/master/db_backups/sql). Currently 2 threads:
-- T1: 1-2M
-- T2: 2-3.5M

- Check if there are any duplicates (see https://github.com/drozas/drupal-org-api/blob/master/scripts/check_dups.sql)



Steps for gephi:
================

- Create unique list of nodes (required by gephi for labels)

- Run 

(SELECT DISTINCT t1.mentored_uid, t1.mentored_username FROM `mentored_by` t1)
UNION
(SELECT DISTINCT t2.mentored_by_uid, t2.mentored_by_username FROM `mentored_by` t2)


- Create CSV including headers (e.g. with calc):
-- ID
-- LABEL

- Run 

SELECT `mentored_uid`, `mentored_by_uid`  FROM `mentored_by` WHERE 1

- Create CSV including headers (e.g. with calc):
-- SOURCE
-- TARGET

- Following steps from (http://gephi.github.io/tutorials/gephi-tutorial-quick_start.pdf)

-- Apply ATLAS layout with 10K repulsion

-- Apply Ranking by degree on nodes
